Hello everyone I'm making an AI/ML app and I want to make an anime recommendation system by having the user input their preferred episode length and genre.
I'm currently working on the AI/ML algorithms to make the successful recommendations and I will make sure to keep everyone updated.

How to run the APP:

1. First Download the project
2. Go to your terminal/command prompt and run "pip install flask"
3. Then open up the downloaded app to any ide
4. Open up the terminal and run "python app.py"
5. Now you should access the app at http://127.0.0.1:5000/
